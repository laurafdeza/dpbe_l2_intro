Previous studies (Casillas & Simonet, 2018; Gonzales & Lotto, 2013; Gonzales, Heinlein, & Lotto, 2019) indicate that bilinguals exhibit a double phonemic boundary (i.e., a difference between labeling functions obtained when listeners find themselves in Spanish mode and those obtained when they are in English mode) for a phoneme continuum (/b/-/p/). These studies provide evidence supporting the notion that there is some degree of separation between phonetic systems in the bilingual mind.

Gonzales & Lotto (2013) investigated how bilinguals perceptually accommodate speech variation across languages. In their experiment, Spanish-English bilinguals and English monolinguals listened to Spanish and English continua of pseudowords ('bafri' and 'pafri') and indicated which of the two "words" was spoken by pressing a key. The language context was manipulated through the instructions and through the phonetic makeup of pseudoword endings. Gonzales & Lotto (2013) found that Spanish-English bilinguals had separate perceptual boundaries depending upon the language-specific continua. The findings suggest that bilinguals adjust perceptual categorization across language contexts by switching between language-specific phonetic systems.

Casillas & Simonet (2018) found further evidence that bilinguals can maintain separate phonetic systems. Specifically, they explored whether Spanish-English bilinguals and native English speaking L2 learners of Spanish utilized different categorization criteria based on language mode (unilingual, bilingual). Crucially, language mode was only phonetically cued via the stimuli of the VOT continua. The study included 2 experiments. In the first experiment, simultaneous Spanish-English bilinguals and beginning adult learners of Spanish showed language-specific perceptual boundaries in independent unilingual sessions, thus replicating Gonzales & Lotto (2013), and extending the finding to L2 learners. In the second experiment Spanish-English bilinguals and late learners of Spanish identified stimuli drawn from the VOT continua in a single, bilingual session. Both early and late bilinguals showed mode-specific perceptual normalization criteria in conditions of rapid, random mode switching. Importantly, the study showed that bilinguals can exploit language-specific perceptual processes in real time and that this ability appears to be modulated by language proficiency in late learners.

Gonzales, Heinlein, & Lotto (2019) continued this line of research by examining whether conceptually-based language selection, which is frequent in the spoken modality, is also possible in the listening modality. In their experiment, Spanish-English bilinguals and French-English bilinguals listened to a /b/-/p/ continuum of the beginnings of language neutral pseudowords (Spanish-English: bafri, pafri; French-English: befru, pefru) and indicated which "word" the speaker was beginning to say. The language context was manipulated conceptually through the instructions only. The study showed that both groups displayed different voicing boundaries that corresponded with the language they believed they were hearing. This suggests that conceptually-based perceptual categorization is possible in highly proficient bilinguals.

In sum, previous research suggests that bilinguals can maintain some degree of separation between sound systems. Language-specific perceptual categorization can be phonetically cued in both early and late bilinguals (Gonzales & Lotto, 2013; Casillas & Simonet, 2018), and conceptually cued in early bilinguals (Gonzales et. al, 2019). The present study builds on this line of research by investigating whether the double phonemic boundary effect can be conceptually cued in adult second language learners of different proficiencies as well.
